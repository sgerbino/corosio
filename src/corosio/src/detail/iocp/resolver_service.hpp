/*
    Windows IOCP Resolver Service
    =============================

    This header declares the Windows resolver implementation using the
    GetAddrInfoExW API, which provides native async DNS resolution that
    integrates with IOCP.

    Unlike POSIX getaddrinfo() which blocks, GetAddrInfoExW accepts a
    completion callback that Windows invokes when resolution finishes.
    This avoids the need for worker threads.

    Class Hierarchy
    ---------------
    - win_resolver_service (execution_context::service)
        - Owns all win_resolver_impl instances
        - Coordinates with win_scheduler for work tracking
    - win_resolver_impl (one per resolver object)
        - Contains embedded resolve_op for reuse
    - resolve_op (overlapped_op subclass)
        - OVERLAPPED base enables IOCP integration
        - Static completion() callback invoked by Windows

    Cancellation
    ------------
    GetAddrInfoExCancel() can cancel in-progress resolutions. The cancel()
    method calls this API and sets an atomic cancelled flag. The completion
    callback checks this flag to determine the error code.

    Single-Inflight Constraint
    --------------------------
    Each resolver has ONE embedded op_. Concurrent resolve() calls on the
    same resolver would corrupt op_ state. This is documented but not
    enforced at runtime. Users must serialize resolve() calls per-resolver.

/** Resolver implementation for IOCP-based async DNS.

    Each resolver instance contains a single embedded operation object (op_)
    that is reused for each resolve() call. This design avoids per-operation
    heap allocation but imposes a critical constraint:

    @par Single-Inflight Contract

    Only ONE resolve operation may be in progress at a time per resolver
    instance. Calling resolve() while a previous resolve() is still pending
    results in undefined behavior:

    - The new call overwrites op_ fields (host, service, coroutine handle)
    - The pending GetAddrInfoExW callback reads corrupted state
    - The wrong coroutine may be resumed, or resumed multiple times
    - Data races occur on non-atomic op_ members

    @par Safe Usage Patterns

    @code
    // CORRECT: Sequential resolves
    auto [ec1, r1] = co_await resolver.resolve("host1", "80");
    auto [ec2, r2] = co_await resolver.resolve("host2", "80");

    // CORRECT: Parallel resolves with separate resolver instances
    resolver r1(ctx), r2(ctx);
    auto [ec1, res1] = co_await r1.resolve("host1", "80");  // in one coroutine
    auto [ec2, res2] = co_await r2.resolve("host2", "80");  // in another

    // WRONG: Concurrent resolves on same resolver
    // These may run concurrently if launched in parallel - UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
    auto f1 = resolver.resolve("host1", "80");
    auto f2 = resolver.resolve("host2", "80");  // BAD: overlaps with f1
    @endcode

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.
    Shared objects: Unsafe. See single-inflight contract above.

    @note Internal implementation detail. Users interact with resolver class.
