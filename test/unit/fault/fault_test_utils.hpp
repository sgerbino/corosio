   A test that parks an operation and expects something else to
   complete it has no way to fail on its own: if the completion never
   comes, run() does not return and the job dies on the CI timeout with
   nothing to say which test was waiting. Spawn one of these under a
   stop source alongside, request the stop where the test finishes, and
   check `expired` after the run.

   The stop source is what keeps the guard from becoming the thing the
   run loop waits for: a pending delay is outstanding work, so a guard
   that is never cancelled costs its full timeout on every test that
   passes. The IOCP suites keep a copy of their own.

   @param expired Set when the guard fired rather than being cancelled.
