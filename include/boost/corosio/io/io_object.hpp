/** Owns the platform-specific handle and execution context that a derived
    socket, timer, signal handler, or acceptor type uses to dispatch
    operations.

    Provides common infrastructure for I/O objects that wrap kernel
    resources (sockets, timers, signal handlers, acceptors). Derived
    classes dispatch operations through a platform-specific vtable
    (IOCP, epoll, kqueue, io_uring).

    @par Semantics
    Only concrete platform I/O types should inherit from `io_object`.
    Test mocks, decorators, and stream adapters must not inherit from
    this class. Use concepts or templates for generic I/O algorithms.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.
    Shared objects: Unsafe. All operations on a single I/O object
    must be serialized.

    @note Intended as a protected base class. The handle member
        `h_` is accessible to derived classes.

    @see io_stream, tcp_socket, tcp_acceptor
