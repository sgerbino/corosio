    Signal Set Public API
    =====================

    This header provides the public interface for asynchronous signal handling.
    The implementation is split across platform-specific files:
      - posix/signals.cpp: Uses sigaction() for robust signal handling
      - iocp/signals.cpp: Uses C runtime signal() (Windows lacks sigaction)

    Key design decisions:

    1. Abstract flag values: The flags_t enum uses arbitrary bit positions
       (not SA_RESTART, etc.) to avoid including <signal.h> in public headers.
       The POSIX implementation maps these to actual SA_* constants internally.

    2. Flag conflict detection: When multiple signal_sets register for the
       same signal, they must use compatible flags. The first registration
       establishes the flags; subsequent registrations must match or use
       dont_care.

    3. Polymorphic implementation: implementation is an abstract base that
       platform-specific implementations (posix_signal, win_signal)
       derive from. This allows the public API to be platform-agnostic.

    4. The inline add(int) overload avoids a virtual call for the common case
       of adding signals without flags (delegates to add(int, none)).

namespace boost::corosio {

/** An asynchronous signal set for coroutine I/O.

    This class provides the ability to perform an asynchronous wait
    for one or more signals to occur. The signal set registers for
    signals using sigaction() on POSIX systems or the C runtime
    signal() function on Windows.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. A signal_set must not have concurrent
    wait operations.

    @par Semantics
    Wraps platform signal handling (sigaction on POSIX, C runtime
    signal() on Windows). Operations dispatch to OS signal APIs
    via the io_context reactor.

    @par Supported Signals
    On Windows, the following signals are supported:
    SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV.

    @par Example
    @code
    signal_set signals(ctx, SIGINT, SIGTERM);
    auto [ec, signum] = co_await signals.wait();
    if (ec == capy::cond::canceled)
    {
        // Operation was cancelled via stop_token or cancel()
    }
    else if (!ec)
    {
        std::cout << "Received signal " << signum << std::endl;
    }
    @endcode
