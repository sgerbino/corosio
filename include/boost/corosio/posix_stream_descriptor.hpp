/* Adoption of an already-open pollable POSIX descriptor.

   The two contract points that are not obvious from the
   declarations:

   assign() requires a closed object and never touches an open one.
   Every failure, validation or kernel refusal, leaves the object
   closed and the fd with the caller.

   On the reactor backends O_NONBLOCK is applied lazily, at the first
   read_some/write_some, and never restored; io_uring never touches
   it. A wait()-only user never triggers it, which is what makes
   adopting STDIN_FILENO safe: flipping the flag would change the
   parent shell's terminal, because the flag lives on the shared open
   file description, not on the descriptor.
*/

namespace boost::corosio {

/** Drives an already-open POSIX descriptor from an `io_context`.

    Wraps an already-open pollable file descriptor and drives it
    from the `io_context`. The kinds in scope are character devices,
    `inotify`, `eventfd`, `timerfd`, `pidfd`, pipes, ttys, and socket
    kinds corosio does not otherwise wrap. The descriptor must come
    from the caller; this type never creates one.

    The type name is deliberately platform-qualified. Portability
    comes from the interfaces it implements, not from the name. A
    `posix_stream_descriptor` is an @ref io_stream. `capy::read`,
    `capy::write`, other `capy::Stream`-constrained algorithms and
    TLS layering therefore work on it exactly as they do on a
    socket.

    @par Ownership
    `assign()` takes ownership and `close()` closes the
    descriptor. To integrate with a library that owns the fd, adopt
    a `dup()` of it: readiness lives on the open file description,
    which both descriptors share.

    @par Descriptor Flags
    `assign()` and `wait()` never modify the descriptor on any
    backend. On epoll, kqueue and select the first `read_some()` or
    `write_some()` sets `O_NONBLOCK` and never restores it. On
    io_uring nothing is ever modified. A transfer the kernel cannot
    complete through its internal poll waits in a kernel worker
    thread. Cancellation reaches it only if the driver's wait is
    interruptible. The flag lives on the shared
    open file description, so restoring it would race every other
    holder. A
    `dup()` is no escape: the duplicate shares that same description,
    so the flag change reaches the other holder anyway. When another
    party owns the descriptor and cannot tolerate `O_NONBLOCK`, use
    `wait()` -- which never modifies the descriptor -- and do the I/O
    yourself.

    @par Rejected Descriptors
    Regular files, block devices, and directories are rejected with
    `errc::operation_not_supported`. @ref stream_file and
    @ref random_access_file adopt regular files and block devices. A
    directory is adoptable by no corosio type. A character device
    the I/O backend cannot watch, such as `/dev/null`, is adopted on
    every I/O backend. On epoll, kqueue, and io_uring, an operation
    on it that would have to wait for readiness completes with
    `errc::operation_not_supported`. The exception is a transfer on
    io_uring when the descriptor is blocking: it waits in a kernel
    worker thread instead. On select, the device is always ready for
    reading and writing. Its `wait(wait_type::error)` waits until
    cancelled, except on macOS, where it completes at once with an
    error. On select, a descriptor at or above `FD_SETSIZE` is
    rejected with `errc::too_many_files_open`. Where a kernel refusal
    surfaces depends on the backend. The epoll and kqueue backends
    register the descriptor during `assign()`, so a refusal fails
    there. What remains to refuse is resource exhaustion (`ENOMEM`,
    `ENOSPC`).
    kqueue watches writes only once a write-direction operation first
    has to wait. A descriptor that refuses write watching is still
    adopted, and such a write or `wait(wait_type::write)` completes
    with the kernel's refusal. The io_uring backend has no adopt-time
    registration, so `assign()` succeeds and takes ownership. The
    refusal appears at the first `read_some()` or `write_some()`.
    select registers nothing with the kernel, so it has no refusal to
    report.

    @par Signals
    Writing to a descriptor whose peer has closed raises `SIGPIPE`
    in the default disposition -- unlike the socket types, which
    suppress it. `MSG_NOSIGNAL` is a `send()` flag with no `writev`
    equivalent, and `SO_NOSIGPIPE` is a socket option, so neither
    applies to an arbitrary descriptor. Callers must install
    `SIG_IGN` for `SIGPIPE` if that is not already the process's
    disposition.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. A descriptor must not have concurrent
    operations of the same type (e.g. two simultaneous reads). One
    read and one write may be in flight simultaneously.
