/** Reads and writes a file sequentially, from a coroutine.

    Provides asynchronous read and write operations on a regular
    file with an implicit position that advances after each
    operation.

    Inherits from @ref io_stream, so `read_some` and `write_some`
    are available and work with any algorithm that accepts an
    `io_stream&`.

    On POSIX platforms, file I/O is dispatched to a thread pool
    (blocking `preadv`/`pwritev`) with completion posted back to
    the scheduler. On Windows, true overlapped I/O is used via IOCP.

    On Windows, while the file is open, its handle is bound to the
    execution context's completion port. Every overlapped call on the
    handle queues a packet to that port. Do not issue your own
    overlapped I/O on `native_handle()` (`DeviceIoControl`,
    `ReadFile`) unless the `OVERLAPPED`'s `hEvent` has its low-order
    bit set, which suppresses the packet.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. Only one asynchronous operation
    may be in flight at a time.

    @par Example
    @par !example stream_file

            `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED`, or one
            already in skip-completion-port-on-success mode. On
            Windows, `errc::invalid_argument` when @p handle is
            bound to another completion port. Any other failure is
            the code reported by the system. Otherwise, the code is

            directory, a pipe, a socket, or any other anonymous inode.
