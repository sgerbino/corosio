/** An asynchronous TCP socket for coroutine I/O.

    This class provides asynchronous TCP socket operations that return
    awaitable types. Each operation participates in the affine awaitable
    protocol, ensuring coroutines resume on the correct executor.

    The socket must be opened before performing I/O operations. Operations
    support cancellation through `std::stop_token` via the affine protocol,
    or explicitly through the `cancel()` member function.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. A socket must not have concurrent operations
    of the same type (e.g., two simultaneous reads). One read and one
    write may be in flight simultaneously.

    @par Semantics
    Wraps the platform TCP/IP stack. Operations dispatch to
    OS socket APIs via the io_context reactor (epoll, IOCP,
    kqueue). Satisfies @ref capy::Stream.

    @par Example
    @code
    io_context ioc;
    tcp_socket s(ioc);
    s.open();

    // Using structured bindings
    auto [ec] = co_await s.connect(
        endpoint(ipv4_address::loopback(), 8080));
    if (ec)
        co_return;

    char buf[1024];
    auto [read_ec, n] = co_await s.read_some(
        capy::mutable_buffer(buf, sizeof(buf)));

        TCP connections are full-duplex: each direction (send and receive)
        operates independently. This function allows you to close one or
        both directions without destroying the socket.

        @li @ref shutdown_send sends a TCP FIN packet to the peer,
            signaling that you have no more data to send. You can still
            receive data until the peer also closes their send direction.
            This is the most common use case, typically called before
            close() to ensure graceful connection termination.

        @li @ref shutdown_receive disables reading on the socket. This
            does NOT send anything to the peer - they are not informed
            and may continue sending data. Subsequent reads will fail
            or return end-of-file. Incoming data may be discarded or
            buffered depending on the operating system.

        @li @ref shutdown_both combines both effects: sends a FIN and
            disables reading.

        When the peer shuts down their send direction (sends a FIN),
        subsequent read operations will complete with `capy::cond::eof`.
        Use the portable condition test rather than comparing error
        codes directly:

        @code
        auto [ec, n] = co_await sock.read_some(buffer);

        {
            // Peer closed their send direction
        }
        @endcode

        Failures such as a peer that already disconnected are
        normal runtime conditions and are reported through the
        returned error code. A closed socket reports
        `errc::bad_file_descriptor`.
