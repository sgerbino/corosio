/** Connects, reads, and writes over TCP, from a coroutine.

    This class provides asynchronous TCP socket operations that return
    awaitable types. Each operation participates in the affine awaitable
    protocol, ensuring coroutines resume on the correct executor.

    The socket must be opened before performing I/O operations. Operations
    support cancellation through `std::stop_token` via the affine protocol,
    or explicitly through the `cancel()` member function.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. A socket must not have concurrent operations
    of the same type (e.g., two simultaneous reads). One read and one
    write may be in flight simultaneously.

    @par Semantics
    Wraps the platform TCP/IP stack. Operations dispatch to
    OS socket APIs via the `io_context` reactor (epoll, IOCP,
    kqueue). Satisfies @ref capy::Stream.

    @par Example
    @par !example connect_and_read

        @li @ref shutdown_send sends a TCP FIN packet to the peer,

            receive data until the peer also closes their send direction.
            This is the most common use case, typically called before
            close() to ensure graceful connection termination.

        @li @ref shutdown_receive disables reading on the socket. This
            does not send anything to the peer. The peer is not informed
            and may continue sending data. Subsequent reads fail
            or return end-of-file. Incoming data may be discarded or
            buffered depending on the operating system.
