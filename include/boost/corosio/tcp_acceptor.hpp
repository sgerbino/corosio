/** Accepts inbound TCP connections, from a coroutine.

    This class provides asynchronous TCP accept operations that return
    awaitable types. The acceptor binds to a local endpoint and listens
    for incoming connections.

    Each accept operation participates in the affine awaitable protocol,
    ensuring coroutines resume on the correct executor.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. An acceptor must not have concurrent accept
    operations.

    @par Semantics
    Wraps the platform TCP listener. Operations dispatch to
    OS accept APIs via the `io_context` reactor.

    @par Example
    @par !example convenience_construction

    @par Example
    @par !example fine_grained_setup
