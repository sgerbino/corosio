/** Reads and writes a file at arbitrary offsets, from a coroutine.

    Provides asynchronous read and write operations at explicit
    byte offsets, without maintaining an implicit file position.

    On POSIX platforms, file I/O is dispatched to a thread pool
    (blocking `preadv`/`pwritev`) with completion posted back to
    the scheduler. On Windows, true overlapped I/O is used via IOCP.

    On Windows, while the file is open, its handle is bound to the
    execution context's completion port. Every overlapped call on the
    handle queues a packet to that port. Do not issue your own
    overlapped I/O on `native_handle()` (`DeviceIoControl`,
    `ReadFile`) unless the `OVERLAPPED`'s `hEvent` has its low-order
    bit set, which suppresses the packet.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe. Coroutines sharing the same file object may
    run multiple concurrent reads and writes. Non-async operations such as open, close, size, and resize require external synchronization.

    @par Example
    @par !example random_access_file
