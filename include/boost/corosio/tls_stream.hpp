/** Reads, writes, and manages the handshake lifecycle of a TLS
    session over an underlying stream.

    This class provides a runtime-polymorphic interface for TLS
    implementations. Derived classes (`openssl_stream`, `wolfssl_stream`)
    implement the virtual functions to provide backend-specific
    TLS functionality.

    An @ref io_stream represents OS-level I/O completed by the kernel.
    TLS streams are coroutine-based instead: their operations are
    coroutines that orchestrate sub-operations on the underlying stream.

    The non-virtual template wrappers (`read_some`, `write_some`)
    satisfy the `capy::Stream` concept, enabling TLS streams to
    be used anywhere a Stream is expected.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe, with one exception: one read operation and
    one write operation may be in flight simultaneously. `shutdown()`
    may overlap a pending read. On a multi-threaded execution context,
    all operations on one stream must run within the same
    `capy::strand`, or must otherwise never run concurrently. A
    single-threaded context needs no strand.
