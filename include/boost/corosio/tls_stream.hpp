/** Abstract base class for TLS streams.

    This class provides a runtime-polymorphic interface for TLS
    implementations. Derived classes (openssl_stream, wolfssl_stream)
    implement the virtual functions to provide backend-specific
    TLS functionality.

    Unlike @ref io_stream which represents OS-level I/O completed
    by the kernel, TLS streams are coroutine-based: their operations
    are implemented as coroutines that orchestrate sub-operations
    on the underlying stream.

    The non-virtual template wrappers (`read_some`, `write_some`)
    satisfy the `capy::Stream` concept, enabling TLS streams to
    be used anywhere a Stream is expected.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe.

    @see openssl_stream, wolfssl_stream

        operations are in progress on this stream.

        @note If called mid-session before `shutdown()`, pending
            TLS data is discarded and the peer will observe a
