/** Encrypts and decrypts a stream using OpenSSL.

    This class wraps an underlying stream satisfying `capy::Stream`
    and provides TLS encryption using the OpenSSL library.

    Derives from @ref tls_stream to provide a runtime-polymorphic
    interface. The TLS operations are implemented as coroutines
    that orchestrate reads and writes on the underlying stream.

    @par Construction Modes

    Two construction modes are supported:

    - **Owning**: Pass stream by value. The `openssl_stream` takes
      ownership. The stream is moved into internal storage.

    - **Reference**: Pass stream by pointer. The `openssl_stream`
      does not own the stream. The caller must ensure the stream
      outlives this object.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Unsafe, with one exception: one read operation and
    one write operation may be in flight simultaneously. `shutdown()`
    may overlap a pending read. On a multi-threaded execution context,
    all operations on one stream must run within the same
    `capy::strand`, or must otherwise never run concurrently. A
    single-threaded context needs no strand.

    @par Example
    @par !example openssl_stream

    @see tls_stream, wolfssl_stream
