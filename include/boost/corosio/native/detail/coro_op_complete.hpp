/*
    Shared completion-tail helpers for proactor ops. Every IOCP and io_uring
    I/O handler ends the same way once its backend-specific result has been
    decoded into ec_out/bytes_out:

      1. disarm the stop_callback,
      2. on the shutdown-drain path (owner == nullptr) just break the
         impl_ptr keepalive cycle and return without resuming,
      3. otherwise resume the coroutine on its executor, dropping the
         keepalive only after the continuation has been handed off.

    The *decode* step (raw DWORD/res -> {ec, bytes, eof, canceled}) stays
    backend-specific because the raw encodings differ; in Phase 3 it is
    formalized as `Traits::decode_result`. These two helpers capture the
    backend-agnostic prologue and resume tail so the per-op handlers shrink to
    "drain-or-decode, then resume".
*/

namespace boost::corosio::detail {

/** Translate a decoded I/O result into `*ec_out` using the cancelled /
    error / EOF / success priority shared by every native backend.

    The raw error encodings differ per backend (reactor positive `errno`,
    io_uring negative `res`, IOCP `DWORD`), so the native-error -> error_code
    step stays backend-local: the caller passes @a err already converted
    (an empty error_code means "no error"). This helper owns only the
    priority logic, which is byte-for-byte identical everywhere:

        cancelled                          -> operation_canceled
        err set                            -> err
        is_read && bytes == 0 && !empty    -> end_of_file
        otherwise                          -> success

    Writes nothing when @a ec_out is null. Does not touch bytes_out — callers
    that report a byte count write it separately (connect/wait carry none).

    @param ec_out        Destination (may be null).
    @param cancelled     The op's cancellation flag.
    @param err           Backend error already converted to error_code, or a
                         default-constructed error_code on success.
    @param is_read       True only for reads that should map a 0-byte
                         completion to EOF — false for writes, connect, wait,
                         and datagrams (a 0-byte datagram is success, not EOF).
    @param bytes         Bytes transferred (consulted only for the EOF test).
    @param empty_buffer  True when the submitted buffer was zero-length,
                         which suppresses the otherwise-spurious EOF.

    therefore this op's storage) may be destroyed as the local goes out of
    scope, so nothing may touch `*self` after the resume.
