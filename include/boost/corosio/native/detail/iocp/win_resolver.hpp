/*
    Windows IOCP Resolver Service
    =============================

    This header declares the Windows resolver implementation.

    Forward Resolution (GetAddrInfoExW)
    -----------------------------------
    Uses the native async GetAddrInfoExW API which provides completion
    callbacks that integrate with IOCP. This avoids worker threads for
    forward DNS lookups.

    Reverse Resolution (GetNameInfoW)
    ---------------------------------
    Unlike GetAddrInfoExW, GetNameInfoW has no async variant. Reverse
    resolution dispatches the blocking call to the shared
    resolver_thread_pool service.

    Class Hierarchy
    ---------------
    - win_resolver_service (execution_context::service)
        - Owns all win_resolver instances through a recycling object_pool
        - Coordinates with win_scheduler for work tracking
    - win_resolver (one per resolver object)
        - Contains embedded resolve_op and reverse_resolve_op
        - Kept alive during I/O by each op's intrusive object_ref_
    - resolve_op (overlapped_op subclass)
        - OVERLAPPED base enables IOCP integration
        - Static completion() callback invoked by Windows
    - reverse_resolve_op (overlapped_op subclass)
        - Used by pool thread for reverse resolution

    Shutdown
    --------
    The resolver service cancels all resolvers; each then stays alive
    until its own in-flight completion drains, same as every other
    pooled impl. The thread pool service shuts down separately via
    execution_context service ordering, joining all worker threads.

    Cancellation
    ------------
    GetAddrInfoExCancel() can cancel in-progress forward resolutions.
    Reverse resolution checks an atomic cancelled flag after GetNameInfoW
    returns. The cancel() method sets flags and calls the Windows cancel API.

    Single-Inflight Constraint
    --------------------------
    Each resolver has ONE embedded op_ for forward resolution and ONE
    reverse_op_ for reverse resolution. Concurrent operations of the same
    type on the same resolver would corrupt state. Users must serialize
    operations per-resolver.
*/

/*
    Windows IOCP Resolver Implementation
    ====================================

    See above for architecture overview.

    Forward Resolution (GetAddrInfoExW)
    -----------------------------------
    1. resolve() converts host/service to wide strings (Windows API requirement)
    2. GetAddrInfoExW() is called with our completion callback
    3. If it returns WSA_IO_PENDING, completion comes later via callback
    4. If it returns immediately (0 or error), we post completion manually
    5. completion() callback stores error, calls work_finished(), posts op
    6. op_() resumes the coroutine with results or error

    Reverse Resolution (GetNameInfoW)
    ---------------------------------
    Unlike GetAddrInfoExW, GetNameInfoW has no async variant. The blocking
    call is dispatched to the shared resolver_thread_pool:
    1. reverse_resolve() posts work to the thread pool
    2. Pool thread calls GetNameInfoW() (blocking)
    3. Pool thread converts wide results to UTF-8 via WideCharToMultiByte
    4. Pool thread posts completion to scheduler
    5. op_() resumes the coroutine with results

    String Conversion
    -----------------
    Windows APIs require wide strings. We use MultiByteToWideChar for
    UTF-8 to UTF-16 and WideCharToMultiByte for UTF-16 to UTF-8.

    Work Tracking
    -------------
    work_started() is called before async operations to keep io_context alive.
    work_finished() is called when the operation completes (in callback for
    forward resolution, in worker thread for reverse resolution).

/** Resolver implementation for IOCP-based async DNS.

    Each resolver instance contains a single embedded operation object (op_)
    that is reused for each resolve() call. This design avoids per-operation
    heap allocation but imposes a critical constraint:

    @par Single-Inflight Contract

    Only ONE resolve operation may be in progress at a time per resolver
    instance. Calling resolve() while a previous resolve() is still pending
    results in undefined behavior:

    - The new call overwrites op_ fields (host, service, coroutine handle)
    - The pending GetAddrInfoExW callback reads corrupted state
    - The wrong coroutine may be resumed, or resumed multiple times
    - Data races occur on non-atomic op_ members

    @par Safe Usage Patterns

    @code
    // CORRECT: Sequential resolves
    auto [ec1, r1] = co_await resolver.resolve("host1", "80");
    auto [ec2, r2] = co_await resolver.resolve("host2", "80");

    // CORRECT: Parallel resolves with separate resolver instances
    resolver r1(ctx), r2(ctx);
    auto [ec1, res1] = co_await r1.resolve("host1", "80");  // in one coroutine
    auto [ec2, res2] = co_await r2.resolve("host2", "80");  // in another

    // WRONG: Concurrent resolves on same resolver
    // These may run concurrently if launched in parallel - UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
    auto f1 = resolver.resolve("host1", "80");
    auto f2 = resolver.resolve("host2", "80");  // BAD: overlaps with f1
    @endcode

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.
    Shared objects: Unsafe. See single-inflight contract above.

    @note Internal implementation detail. Users interact with resolver class.
