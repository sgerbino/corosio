/** Auxiliary select-based reactor for IOCP wait operations.

    IOCP has no native primitive for socket readiness without I/O.
    For cases where a zero-byte WSARecv won't work (datagram-read,
    acceptor-read, write-wait, error-wait), this reactor runs a
    dedicated thread using WSAPoll to detect readiness and posts a
    synthetic completion to the owning IOCP scheduler via
    win_scheduler::on_completion().

    The same dispatch path used by overlapped I/O then delivers the
    completion to the user's coroutine, so the public API is uniform
    across backends.

    Per-op lifecycle:
    1. Caller sets up an overlapped_op (h, ex, ec_out, cancelled flag).
    2. Caller calls register_wait(fd, w, op) and returns
       std::noop_coroutine. The op is parked in the reactor's table.
    3. Reactor thread polls. When the fd is ready, the op is removed
       from the table and posted to the scheduler. The error code
       delivered to the completion is: ec={} on success; the SO_ERROR
       value if error revents fired and SO_ERROR is set; or
       WSAECONNABORTED as a synthesized fallback for wait_type::error
       when error revents fired but SO_ERROR returned zero.
    4. On socket cancel(), the user's thread calls cancel_wait(op),
       which queues a cancel request. The reactor thread removes the
       op from the table and posts a completion; invoke_handler sees
       op.cancelled==true and yields capy::cond::canceled.

    The constructor builds the wakeup channel and throws if it cannot:
    a reactor that cannot be woken can never report readiness, so
    there is no reactor worth handing back. The polling thread is a
    separate cost, paid by the first register_wait, so a context that
    never waits never carries one.

    Thread-safe: register_wait, cancel_wait, and stop may be called
    from any thread.
