/** Per-descriptor state shared across reactor backends.

    Tracks pending operations for a file descriptor. The fd is registered
    once with the reactor and stays registered until closed. Uses deferred
    I/O: the reactor sets ready_events atomically, then enqueues this state.
    When popped by the scheduler, invoke_deferred_io() performs I/O under
    the mutex and queues completed ops.

    Non-template: uses reactor_op_base pointers so the scheduler and
    descriptor_state code exist as a single copy in the binary regardless
    of how many backends are compiled in.

    @par Thread Safety
    The mutex protects operation pointers and ready flags. ready_events_
    and is_enqueued_ are atomic for lock-free reactor access.
