/*
    Shared, non-template op envelope for every native backend — the readiness
    reactors (epoll/kqueue/select), io_uring, and IOCP. It captures the part of
    an async operation that is identical regardless of how completion is
    reported: the coroutine to resume, the executor it dispatches on, the
    output pointers, the stop_token wiring, the cancelled flag, and the
    keepalive that holds the owning impl alive while the op is in flight.

    What is deliberately NOT here (it differs by backend and stays in the
    derived op layer):
      - the result model: the reactors re-run the syscall and record
        `errn`/`bytes_transferred` (reactor_op_base); io_uring stores the raw
        `res`/`cqe_flags`; IOCP stores `dwError`/`bytes_transferred`. Each
        decodes its own result.
      - the submission + the kernel cancel action. Cancellation is unified only
        at the call site via the virtual `on_cancel()` hook: the stop_callback
        always targets `coro_op`, and each backend overrides `on_cancel()` —
        the reactors route to the owning impl's cancel(), io_uring submits an
        ASYNC_CANCEL SQE, IOCP calls the stored cancel_func_/CancelIoEx.

    See tasks/proactor-dedup-decisions.md and coro-op-unification-scope.md.

    Derives from scheduler_op so ops queue intrusively and dispatch through the
    function-pointer (io_uring/IOCP) or virtual (reactors) completion path —
    hence both a default and a func_type constructor.

    @note For IOCP, the concrete op multiply-inherits `OVERLAPPED` as its
    first base (so `static_cast<OVERLAPPED*>` round-trips); `coro_op`
    follows it.
