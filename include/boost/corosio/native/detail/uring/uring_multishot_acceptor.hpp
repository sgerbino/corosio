    /** Pooled accept node: parked waiter and posted completion in one.

        A parked accept used to be a `waiter_node` whose fields were
        copied into a freshly allocated `uring_accept_op` at every
        completion boundary. The two had strictly sequential lifetimes
        (a waiter *becomes* a completion), so this node is both at
        once — the intrusive hook parks it in `waiters_`/`free_nodes_`
        and the inherited op posts it to the scheduler. Nodes recycle
        through the owning acceptor's `free_nodes_` via `dispose`, so
        steady-state accepts allocate nothing.

        The inherited `cancelled` flag is the claim token: delivery,
        arming-failure, and cancellation each claim the node with one
        `exchange`, and the loser leaves completion to the winner.
        Because the flag also decides how `do_handler` reports the
        completion, every claiming path stores the final status after
        `stop_cb.reset()` (which synchronizes with any in-flight
        canceller) and before posting.

        While in flight — parked or posted — the node holds an
        `object_ref` on its acceptor (the inherited `object_ref_`
        slot), so the impl cannot retire out from under `dispose`.

    /** Retire the multishot op before the acceptor changes descriptor
        or is recycled.

        `cancel_and_flush` and `submit_cancel_by_fd` only submit: the
        terminating CQE for the previous arming is still queued when
        the caller returns. Left alone, a subsequent `start_multishot`
        would alias one `user_data` across two kernel ops, and the
        stale `!more` CQE would observe a cleared `closing_` and take
        the re-arm branch.

        Ownership therefore moves to the scheduler rather than being
        drained here. Draining is a teardown-only tool — it consumes
        CQEs without dispatching them, so on a live context it would
        swallow unrelated ops' completions and park their coroutines
        forever. Handing the op over keeps the normal run loop in
        charge of every CQE, and the op stays allocated (so its
        `user_data` stays reserved) until the kernel is done with it.
        An op the kernel owes nothing is freed instead.

        Safe with no op armed, and safe after `release_socket` left
        `fd_` cleared with the op still in flight.
