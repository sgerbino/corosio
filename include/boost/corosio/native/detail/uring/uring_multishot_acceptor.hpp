    /** Pooled accept node: parked waiter and posted completion in one.

        A parked accept used to be a `waiter_node` whose fields were
        copied into a freshly allocated `uring_accept_op` at every
        completion boundary. The two had strictly sequential lifetimes
        (a waiter *becomes* a completion), so this node is both at
        once — the intrusive hook parks it in `waiters_`/`free_nodes_`
        and the inherited op posts it to the scheduler. Nodes recycle
        through the owning acceptor's `free_nodes_` via `dispose`, so
        steady-state accepts allocate nothing.

        The inherited `cancelled` flag is the claim token: delivery,
        arming-failure, and cancellation each claim the node with one
        `exchange`, and the loser leaves completion to the winner.
        Because the flag also decides how `do_handler` reports the
        completion, every claiming path stores the final status after
        `stop_cb.reset()` (which synchronizes with any in-flight
        canceller) and before posting.

        While in flight — parked or posted — the node holds an
        `object_ref` on its acceptor (the inherited `object_ref_`
        slot), so the impl cannot retire out from under `dispose`.
